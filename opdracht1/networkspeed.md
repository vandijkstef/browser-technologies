# Network speed
Network speeds decide how fast you will receive the content.

## How to test
* Chrome: The network speed can be limited in the Network tab in the developer tools
* Firefox: Extra -> Webdeveloper -> Responsive design mode

## Problems
Networks can be unstable or just simply slow. One one hand, the user will have to wait longer for the page to load, which is a slightly unpleasant experience. On the other hand, slow loading websites will keep rendering, usually jumping up and down the page to adjust to the newly added content. This experience heavily influences the user, since the site "moves" without any user input, and will feel inresponsive for a brief moment when a new piece of content is loaded (like an image)
